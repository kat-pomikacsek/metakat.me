	<p>My name is Katalin Pomikacsek and I am an Austrian User Experience Designer living in Berlin. Over the last decade I have contributed to the development of websites, web applications and mobile apps from kickoff to launch. My aim is to provide users with easy-to-use and engaging products and by doing this, help stakeholders achieve their business goals. To optimize the quality of the user experience from every perspective, I cooperate closely with colleagues from all fields.</p>
	<h2>My Background</h2>
	<p>After my education as multimedia producer (SAE Vienna, 2002) I worked as a designer across different contexts (animation, print and web) and completed my master's degree in Sociology (University of Vienna, 2008). From 2010 on, my focus shifted to user centered design, where I can equally put to use my experience in design and my sociological knowledge of researching human behaviour.</p>
	<h2>Off-Topic</h2>
	<p>Outside of work I love going exploring on long hikes both at home and abroad. I am curious about different perspectives and cultures, which shows in many ways, such as my growing collection of graphic novels from around the world. Whenever there is an opportunity, I also enjoy taking on crafts and DIY projects to solve the small design challenges of everyday life.</p>
